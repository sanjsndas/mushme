                            <p class="ml-4">We use both session cookies, which are temporary and deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. We also utilize first-party cookies (set by Mushme) and third-party cookies (set by partners like analytics or advertising services).

                            <p class="ml-4">In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs). These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails.
