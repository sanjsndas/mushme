The invalid provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect as if the invalid provision had never been included. Furthermore, in such an event, the parties agree to replace the invalid provision with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the severed provision, ensuring the continued viability of the agreement.</p>

A waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No waiver by Mushme of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Mushme to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. All rights and remedies of Mushme shall be cumulative and not alternative.</p>

They are provided solely to assist in navigating this extensive document and do not carry any legal weight in defining, limiting, or explaining the scope or extent of any section.

This limitation applies to all forms of direct damages, ensuring that any financial compensation for which Mushme may be held liable is capped at a reasonable and predictable amount. This provision safeguards Mushme from excessive financial exposure, allowing us to continue providing our services sustainably. It establishes a clear maximum liability, regardless of the nature or severity of the claim, providing both parties with clarity regarding potential financial obligations and preventing disproportionate claims that could jeopardize the company's operations.

This clause acknowledges that legal frameworks vary, and while Mushme aims for broad applicability of its limitations, it will always comply with mandatory local laws. It ensures that even where specific exclusions are not permitted, Mushme's liability will be reduced to the absolute minimum allowed by the governing jurisdiction's statutes. This adaptability ensures legal compliance while still striving to limit exposure where legally permissible, providing a balanced approach to liability across different regulatory environments. It is crucial for users to understand that their specific legal rights may vary based on their geographic location and local consumer protection laws, and this clause explicitly addresses that variability.</p>

While we reserve the right to monitor and remove inappropriate content, we are not obligated to do so, and the responsibility for User Content rests solely with the individual who posted it. This ensures that the burden of legal responsibility for user-generated material is not unfairly transferred to Mushme, maintaining a clear distinction between our content and contributions from the community.

Your interaction with external sites is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies, and Mushme disclaims all responsibility for such interactions. This provision ensures that Mushme's liability is confined to its own platform and does not extend to the vast and varied content available on the broader internet, over which we have no control, thereby protecting us from the actions of external entities.</p>

This clause establishes a strict time limit for initiating legal proceedings against Mushme, encouraging prompt resolution of disputes. It ensures that potential claims do not remain open indefinitely, providing a clear statute of limitations for any grievances related to the Services. This is a common legal provision designed to promote finality in legal matters and prevent stale claims from being brought forward years after an event, contributing to legal certainty and operational efficiency for Mushme.</p>

THIS MEANS THAT THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF MUSHME WILL NOT EXCEED THE CAP SPECIFIED IN SECTION 8.2, REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY CLAIMS ARE BROUGHT OR THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THOSE CLAIMS. This ensures that the financial cap on liability is an absolute maximum, preventing multiple claims from exceeding this limit. It reinforces the comprehensive nature of Mushme's liability limitations, providing a clear and predictable framework for managing potential financial risks.

This includes, but is not limited to, your User Content, your use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms, or your use of any information obtained from the Services. This broad indemnity clause ensures that Mushme is protected from legal and financial repercussions stemming from your actions or omissions that breach this agreement or cause harm to others through your use of our platform.

This extends to any property damage or personal injury resulting from your cultivation or use of our products. This clause emphasizes that while Mushme provides the kits, the responsibility for safe and proper use, including identification before consumption, rests entirely with the user, thereby protecting Mushme from liabilities stemming from user negligence or improper application of the products.</p>

This includes, but is not limited to, disputes with other users, issues arising from third-party payment processors or shipping carriers, or problems encountered on external websites. Mushme facilitates connections but does not control these third-party entities, and this clause ensures that any liabilities arising from such external interactions are borne by the user, who is responsible for their own engagement with third parties.</p>

You will not, in any event, settle any claim without the prior written consent of Mushme. This ensures that Mushme has control over its legal defense strategies when faced with claims arising from your actions, protecting its interests and reputation while still holding you accountable for the underlying liability.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">The indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 9 shall survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services. This means that even after your account is closed or you cease using Mushme's platform, your obligation to indemnify Mushme for claims arising from your prior conduct will remain in full force and effect. This ensures long-term protection for Mushme against liabilities that may only manifest or be discovered after your direct engagement with the Services has ended, providing ongoing legal security for the company.</p>

This comprehensive scope ensures that Mushme is fully compensated for any adverse financial or legal impact directly attributable to your non-compliance or misconduct, covering a wide range of potential liabilities and ensuring Mushme's financial integrity.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">You agree to promptly notify Mushme of any claim or demand that may be subject to indemnification under these Terms. Timely notification is crucial to allow Mushme to take appropriate action, including participating in the defense or settlement of the claim. Failure to provide prompt notification may affect Mushme's ability to defend itself and may, at Mushme's sole discretion, reduce or eliminate your indemnification obligations. This ensures effective cooperation and management of potential legal issues.</p>

This means that Mushme is not limited to seeking indemnification but may also pursue other legal avenues, such as injunctive relief, specific performance, or direct damages, to address any breaches of these Terms or other unlawful conduct by you. This ensures that Mushme retains a full array of legal options to protect its interests and enforce its rights.</p>

This reinforces your responsibility for account security and ensures that Mushme is not liable for issues stemming from your negligence in protecting your login information.

                            <p class="ml-4">These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. This choice of law ensures consistency in legal interpretation and application, providing a clear legal framework for all interactions between you and Mushme. It means that any legal questions or disputes arising from these Terms will be resolved under the specific statutes and precedents of Georgia law, irrespective of your physical location, thereby establishing a predictable legal environment for both parties.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, OR VALIDITY THEREOF, OR THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, SHALL BE FINALLY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE HEREBY WAIVED. This clause mandates that most disputes be settled through arbitration, a private and less formal process than court litigation, aiming for quicker and more cost-effective resolutions. It explicitly prohibits class action lawsuits, meaning disputes must be pursued individually.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">10.3. Arbitration Procedures:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA rules. The arbitration shall take place in Atlanta, Georgia, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon both parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award all remedies available at law or in equity, including injunctive relief, but shall not have the power to award punitive damages. This outlines the specific operational details of the arbitration process.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MUSHME EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. This is a crucial waiver, meaning you give up your right to have a jury decide your case and your right to be part of a group lawsuit. This ensures that disputes are handled individually and through arbitration, streamlining the resolution process and avoiding the complexities and costs associated with large-scale litigation. It is a significant legal concession that you make by agreeing to these Terms.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="ml-4">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of such court's jurisdiction. Furthermore, either party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. This ensures that certain types of disputes, particularly those involving intellectual property or minor claims, can still be addressed in traditional courts, providing a necessary carve-out from the general arbitration requirement.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">10.6. Confidentiality of Arbitration:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings and the award, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcing the arbitration award. This confidentiality provision ensures that sensitive business information and personal details revealed during the arbitration process remain private, protecting both parties from public disclosure of potentially damaging information. It promotes a more discreet and controlled resolution environment compared to public court proceedings.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">10.7. Costs of Arbitration:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The allocation of arbitration fees and expenses, including the arbitrator's fees, will be governed by the AAA rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration and the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Mushme will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your demand for arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. For claims exceeding $75,000, the allocation of fees will be determined by the AAA rules. This provision aims to make arbitration accessible for smaller claims by potentially reducing the financial burden on the user, while still maintaining fairness for larger disputes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms (e.g., for intellectual property claims or small claims), you agree that such actions shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Atlanta, Georgia. You hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action. This clause specifies the exclusive geographical location for any court cases, ensuring that Mushme is not required to defend itself in multiple jurisdictions, thereby centralizing legal proceedings and providing predictability regarding the forum for dispute resolution.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">10.9. Injunctive Relief:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">Notwithstanding the arbitration provisions, Mushme reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, or for any other urgent matter where monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. This ensures that Mushme can take immediate legal action to protect its critical assets and prevent irreparable harm, even while other disputes may proceed through arbitration, providing a dual approach to legal protection.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">If any part of this "Governing Law and Dispute Resolution" section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. However, if the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision (except for this sentence) shall be null and void, and the dispute shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Atlanta, Georgia. This ensures that the core intent of individual arbitration is preserved, and if the class action waiver fails, the dispute reverts to traditional litigation in a specified venue, maintaining a clear path for dispute resolution.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and Disclaimer, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Mushme regarding your use of the Services, superseding all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. This comprehensive agreement represents the complete understanding of the parties, and no oral representations, promises, or agreements outside of this written document shall be binding. Any purported modification or amendment to these Terms must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Mushme to be valid and enforceable, ensuring legal clarity and preventing disputes over unwritten agreements.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.2. Severability:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions. The invalid provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect as if the invalid provision had never been included. Furthermore, in such an event, the parties agree to replace the invalid provision with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the severed provision, ensuring the continued viability of the agreement and upholding the overall purpose of these Terms.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.3. Assignment:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Mushme's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms without such consent will be null and void. Mushme may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. This ensures that the contractual relationship remains between the original parties unless Mushme explicitly agrees to a transfer, maintaining control over who is bound by these obligations and protecting Mushme's interests in the event of a business transfer or reorganization.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.4. No Waiver:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The failure of Mushme to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. A waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No waiver by Mushme of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Mushme to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. All rights and remedies of Mushme shall be cumulative and not alternative, ensuring that Mushme's legal options are not diminished by inaction.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Mushme as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. These Terms are solely for the benefit of you and Mushme and are not intended to create any rights or benefits for any third party, except as expressly provided herein. This clause clarifies the independent nature of the relationship, ensuring that neither party can claim a partnership or employment status based on the use of the Services, which is crucial for legal and tax purposes, and prevents unintended third-party beneficiaries from asserting rights under this agreement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">Any provisions of these Terms that, by their nature, should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability. This ensures that certain obligations and protections remain in effect even after your use of the Services ceases or your account is terminated. Such provisions are fundamental to protecting Mushme's long-term interests and managing residual risks, ensuring that legal responsibilities and rights persist beyond the active period of service engagement, providing ongoing legal clarity and accountability for both parties.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">The headings and section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. They are provided solely to assist in navigating this extensive document and do not carry any legal weight in defining, limiting, or explaining the scope or extent of any section. Therefore, when interpreting any clause, reliance should be placed solely on the substantive content of the paragraph or subsection, rather than the descriptive heading, ensuring that the full legal intent is accurately understood and applied, preventing misinterpretations based on summary titles.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">You agree that your electronic signature, including your assent to these Terms by clicking "I Agree" or by using the Services, is the legal equivalent of your manual signature. You consent to receive communications from Mushme in an electronic form, and you agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Mushme provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in writing. This facilitates efficient and legally binding digital interactions, streamlining communication and agreement processes.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">Mushme welcomes your feedback and suggestions regarding the Services. However, please do not submit any unsolicited ideas, suggestions, or materials. If you do submit any such ideas, you agree that Mushme is free to use them without any obligation or compensation to you, and you waive any claims related to such submissions. This policy protects Mushme from potential disputes regarding intellectual property ownership of unsolicited ideas, ensuring that any improvements or innovations derived from user feedback can be freely implemented without legal encumbrance, while still valuing user input for service enhancement.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">You agree not to export or re-export any Mushme products or technology obtained from the Services, except in compliance with the export control laws and regulations of the United States and any other applicable countries. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. This ensures compliance with international trade laws and prevents the use of Mushme products in restricted territories or by sanctioned individuals, upholding global legal standards.</p>

This includes, but is not limited to, laws pertaining to intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, and any specific regulations regarding the cultivation or possession of fungi in your jurisdiction. Mushme makes no representation that the Services or products are appropriate or available for use in all locations. Your access to the Services from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited. You are responsible for any consequences of your non-compliance.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">These Terms are written in English. Any translation of these Terms into another language is provided for convenience only, and the English version shall prevail in the event of any conflict or inconsistency. This ensures that the authoritative legal text remains consistent, preventing misinterpretations that could arise from linguistic nuances in translation. In any legal dispute or interpretation, the English version will be the sole binding document, providing clarity and preventing ambiguity across different linguistic contexts.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">The parties agree that these Terms shall be construed fairly, and not strictly for or against either party, regardless of which party drafted these Terms. This principle of construction ensures that the agreement is interpreted impartially, promoting fairness in any dispute resolution. It prevents either party from gaining an unfair advantage based on drafting expertise and encourages a balanced application of the terms, fostering a more equitable legal framework for both Mushme and its users, thereby strengthening the overall integrity of the agreement.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4">The remedies provided in these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. This means that Mushme is not limited to the specific remedies outlined in this agreement but may pursue any available legal or equitable relief to enforce its rights or address your breach of these Terms. This ensures that Mushme has a full array of options to protect its interests, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, or specific performance, providing comprehensive legal recourse beyond the explicit provisions of this document.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="ml-4">Except as expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. This means that no person or entity other than you and Mushme can enforce any part of this agreement. This ensures that the contractual relationship is strictly between the direct parties, preventing unintended third parties from asserting rights or claims based on this agreement, thereby simplifying the legal framework and limiting potential liabilities to those explicitly defined within the direct contractual relationship.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.16. Force Majeure:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">Mushme shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms where such failure or delay results from any cause beyond Mushme's reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials, or failures of telecommunications or information services infrastructure. This ensures that Mushme is excused from performance during events beyond its control, protecting it from liabilities arising from unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, providing a necessary legal safeguard for business continuity.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.17. Independent Contractors:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The relationship between you and Mushme is that of independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party has the authority to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other's behalf. This clarifies the nature of the legal relationship, ensuring that neither party can claim a formal association beyond that of independent entities engaging in a service agreement, which is important for legal, tax, and operational clarity, preventing unintended liabilities or obligations.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">All rights and remedies provided under these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to Mushme under law or in equity. This means that Mushme can pursue multiple legal avenues simultaneously or consecutively to address a breach or enforce its rights, without being limited to a single course of action. This provision ensures maximum flexibility and effectiveness in Mushme's ability to protect its interests and enforce the terms of this agreement, providing a robust legal framework for redress.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.19. Interpretation Against Drafter:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The rule of construction that ambiguities in a contract are to be construed against the drafter shall not apply to the interpretation of these Terms. This means that despite Mushme having drafted this document, any ambiguities will be interpreted fairly and impartially, rather than automatically in your favor. This ensures a balanced legal interpretation, promoting equitable application of the terms and preventing one party from gaining an unfair advantage based solely on the drafting process, fostering a more just and consistent application of the agreement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.20. Survival of Representations and Warranties:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">All representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements made by you in these Terms shall survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services. This ensures that your commitments and guarantees made within this agreement remain legally binding even after your active engagement with Mushme's services ceases. This provides long-term protection for Mushme against any misrepresentations or breaches that may only become apparent or cause harm at a later date, ensuring ongoing accountability for your past actions and statements made under these Terms.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.21. No Partnership or Agency:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">Nothing contained in these Terms shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between you and Mushme. You are an independent user, and Mushme is an independent service provider. Neither party has the authority to bind or commit the other party in any manner or for any purpose. This reiterates the independent nature of the relationship, preventing any unintended legal implications such as shared liability or mutual obligations beyond those explicitly stated in these Terms, ensuring clear roles and responsibilities.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.22. Waiver of Consequential Damages:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO SEEK INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES FROM MUSHME, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS. This explicit waiver reinforces the limitation of liability clause, ensuring that you cannot pursue these specific types of damages, even if they are a direct result of an issue with the Services. This is a crucial protection for Mushme, limiting its financial exposure to direct and foreseeable losses, and preventing claims for speculative or indirect harm, which is vital for maintaining economic viability and operational predictability within the business model.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.23. No Third-Party Rights:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">These Terms are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of these Terms. This ensures that only the direct parties to the agreement (you and Mushme) can enforce its provisions, preventing external individuals or organizations from claiming rights or benefits, thereby simplifying the legal landscape and preventing unintended liabilities or obligations to third parties.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p class="ml-4">All rights and remedies provided in these Terms are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in equity. This means that Mushme is not limited to the specific remedies outlined in this agreement but may pursue any available legal or equitable relief to enforce its rights or address your breach of these Terms. This ensures that Mushme has a full array of options to protect its interests, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, or specific performance, providing comprehensive legal recourse beyond the explicit provisions of this document.</p>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.25. Entire Agreement Reiteration:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">These Terms, including any documents incorporated by reference, represent the entire agreement between you and Mushme concerning your use of the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, proposals, and agreements, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and Mushme with respect to the Services. This clause is a powerful legal statement that ensures that only the terms explicitly written in this document and its referenced policies are legally binding, preventing any reliance on previous discussions or informal agreements, thereby providing a clear and definitive legal framework for the relationship.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.26. No Oral Modification:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">No oral statement or representation by any employee, agent, or representative of Mushme shall be deemed to modify, amend, or waive any provision of these Terms. Any modification or amendment to these Terms must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Mushme to be valid and enforceable. This ensures that changes to this legally binding agreement can only be made through a formal, documented process, preventing informal verbal agreements from altering the terms and providing legal certainty for both parties by requiring written consent for any amendments.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.27. Interpretation of "Including":</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">The terms "including" and "include" as used in these Terms shall be deemed to mean "including without limitation" or "including but not limited to." This clarification ensures that lists or examples provided within the Terms are not exhaustive but merely illustrative, allowing for broader interpretation of the scope of various provisions. This common legal drafting technique prevents unintended restrictions on the meaning of clauses and ensures that the terms are applied comprehensively, covering a wide range of scenarios without being overly prescriptive.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.28. Construction and Severability:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision. This ensures that the entire agreement does not collapse due to a single problematic clause, allowing the remaining valid parts to continue governing the relationship, thereby maintaining the overall integrity and enforceability of the Terms despite partial invalidity.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p class="font-semibold text-spore-brown">11.29. Equitable Remedies:</p>
                            <p class="ml-4">You acknowledge that a breach of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to Mushme for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, you agree that Mushme shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to any other remedies available at law. This ensures that Mushme can pursue immediate court orders to prevent ongoing harm, particularly for intellectual property infringement or other severe breaches, where financial compensation alone would not suffice to protect its interests, providing a crucial mechanism for rapid legal intervention.</p>

This ensures that the terms of the agreement remain applicable to any entities that legally succeed or are assigned the rights and obligations of either party, providing continuity in the contractual relationship even through changes in ownership or legal structure. It safeguards Mushme's rights and obligations across potential business transformations and ensures consistent enforcement.</p>

This provision is typically used in agreements where parties sign separate copies of the same document, and it ensures that all signed copies collectively form a single, legally binding agreement. While less common for online terms accepted by user clicks, its inclusion reinforces the formal and comprehensive nature of the agreement, treating electronic acceptance as equivalent to physical signature across multiple copies.</p>

This clause emphasizes that strict adherence to deadlines and performance times is critical to the agreement, and any delays or failures to meet specified timelines may constitute a material breach. It allows Mushme to enforce timely performance of your obligations, particularly concerning payments or adherence to usage policies, and provides a basis for remedies if deadlines are not met, ensuring operational efficiency and contractual discipline.</p>

This clause emphasizes that you are entering into this agreement with full awareness and without coercion, having had the chance to seek professional advice. It strengthens the enforceability of the Terms by demonstrating that you were given the opportunity to understand your legal obligations fully before accepting them, thereby minimizing claims of misunderstanding or lack of informed consent.</p>

This means that any ambiguities or uncertainties in the language of the Terms will not automatically be resolved in your favor simply because Mushme created the document. Instead, the interpretation will be based on the plain meaning of the text and the overall intent of the agreement, promoting a fair and balanced application of the terms regardless of authorship, ensuring equitable treatment in legal interpretation.</p>

You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.
